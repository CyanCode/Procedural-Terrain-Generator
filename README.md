## Overview
---
This is a procedural terrain generator for the Unity 3D engine. It features a node generator construction  system, material splatting, and a programmable generation pipeline API.

## Key Features:
- A node/graph editor for easy--- programming-free generation
- Uses a Mesh rather than Unity Terrain for lower level customization and optimization
- Heightmap-free generation
- Node graphs are saved in a json file and can be shared/imported across different computers
- Fully programmable generation pipeline API
- A material editor that stamps textures based on height and angle
- An event system that reports different stages of execution allowing insertion of custom code
- A chunk-based infinite terrain system that caches previously visited chunks 
- Compatibility with procedural material shaders (such as MegaSplatâ€™s) 
- In-editor terrain previewing 
- Deferred collider generation for chunks that are outside a set radius
